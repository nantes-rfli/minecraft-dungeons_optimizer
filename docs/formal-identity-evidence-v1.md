# Formal Identity / Evidence v1

This contract formalizes only equipment identity and its evidence boundary. It does not formalize gameplay values, attack configuration, projectiles, armor properties, or gameplay-effect semantics.

## Artifact boundary

The committed artifact is `research/domain/formal/identity-evidence-v1.json`. Its three same-artifact planes are:

```text
semantic.identities[]
  rawEvidence: known(value) | unavailable
  resolution: matched | unresolved
  presentation: present only when matched

identityAssertions[]
  reviewState: accepted | provisional
  confidence: high | omitted
  fixed Raw application scope

provenance.evidence[]
  reviewed support / limitation / conflict
  Raw observations and exact existing node/parent provenance
```

Assertion review and Raw resolution are independent. A provisional assertion can resolve as `matched`; a decoded value such as `Other` remains `known("Other")` while its resolution is `unresolved`. Detailed unavailable reasons stay in provenance rather than expanding the semantic observation state.

## Matching rules

The v1 projector accepts only Raw schema 2, the assertion's exact package path, exactly one CDO, and exact decoded `NameProperty` values at both `ItemIdName` and `ItemId.SerializedId`. Both values must equal `assertion.rawIdentity`. Missing or ambiguous nodes trace an existing parent or collection and never invent a node pointer.

For a match, `resolution.domainId` is materialized from the referenced assertion. An unresolved resolution has no `domainId` and exposes no presentation. The application-facing adapter reads only `semantic.identity.resolution` and never falls back to assertion, presentation, or repository catalog IDs.

## Evidence integrity

Every assertion, resolution, observation, and presentation `EvidenceRef` resolves within the same artifact. The audit rejects duplicate IDs, dangling refs, mismatched semantic/Raw observations, assertion/resolution evidence mixing, and evidence content changed without updating its stored fingerprint. Fingerprints are drift tripwires, not cryptographic authenticity claims.

The audit keeps the four representative assertions grounded exactly as before and preserves the existing horizontal paths for 24 reviewed Melee identities and 21 reviewed Ranged identities. It adds a separate, narrow reviewed-bridge path for Bonehead Hammer, Sinister Sword, and Shrieking Crossbow. Those three require the exact `accepted/high` alias, a single exact canonical candidate, the exact Raw identity and scoped instance package, basis `serialized-item-id + documented-entity-alias + catalog-category-evidence`, and the exact canonical-key → Raw-identity mapping in `scripts/equipment-icons.ts` `ENTITY_OVERRIDES`. The generated icon manifest is not treated as independent identity evidence. Raw candidate status, package/name similarity, family, icon ordinal, `_Spooky1` suffix, or slug derivation never creates a Formal assertion.

The 136 inventory-backed horizontal observations comprise 24 Melee, 21 Ranged, 3 reviewed Melee/Ranged bridges, 6 ready-direct Artifacts, 70 Armor identities, and 12 reviewed Artifact bridges. They are read from the committed Raw Structural Inventory shards rather than requiring new full Raw snapshots. The adapter verifies each selected shard's compressed and uncompressed SHA-256, binary-searches the deterministic package ordering, requires the exact scoped package and one CDO, and reads only `ItemIdName` plus `ItemId.SerializedId`. Raw evidence retains the shard path, dataset ID, parser run ID, package path/hash, and shard-local node pointer. The four representative identities continue to use their existing full-Raw path, so their assertions, semantic results, EvidenceRefs, and provenance remain unchanged.

Each ready-direct Artifact definition is fail-closed against its existing `accepted/high` `artifact:<rawIdentity>` alias: category, raw identity, canonical entity, and exact application-scope package path must match. Its Structural observation must resolve that exact package's single CDO, with both identity fields equal to the alias `rawIdentity`. The 12 Artifact reviewed bridges additionally require an exact `ENTITY_OVERRIDES` key/value, one Structural candidate with role `instance`, one CDO, an accepted/high `artifact:<rawIdentity>` alias with the canonical Artifact domain, and byte-exact agreement between the bridge and both serialized identity fields. The generated icon manifest remains a presentation/search hint, not identity evidence. The three case-mismatch targets and 22 slug-normalization-only targets remain outside Formal Identity.

Generate and verify with:

```bash
npm run generate:formal-identity-evidence
npm run audit:formal-identity-evidence
npx vitest run tests/formalIdentityEvidence.test.ts tests/formalIdentitySourceGrounding.test.ts
```

The committed artifact contains 140 matched identities: 27 Melee, 23 Ranged, 71 Armor, and 19 Artifacts. The existing 128 definitions remain first and are protected by a compatibility fingerprint over their assertions, semantic identities, and evidence/provenance; the twelve new Artifact bridges are appended after them. The original 52 definitions and six ready-direct Artifacts keep their previous positions, and Battle Robe remains within the Armor population. Outside this implementation, 131 identities remain: 25 from the reviewed-bridge adjudication (three case mismatches and 22 slug-only records), 73 ambiguous, 30 needing additional identity evidence, and 3 raw-unavailable. Formal Identity schema v1 is unchanged; Value/Availability v2, Serialized Relation, Application, Optimizer, Raw Structural Inventory artifacts, and Native Analysis are unchanged by this expansion.
